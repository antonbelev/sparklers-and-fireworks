## Creating Your Own:

You can create simple particle textures:

1. Create a small canvas (32x32 or 64x64 pixels)
2. Draw a bright circle with soft edges (gradient from white center to transparent)
3. Save as PNG with transparency
4. Name according to the scheme above

## Usage:

The app will automatically use these textures if present, otherwise it will use procedural canvas rendering.
